# Speech_Recognition_System

I have built a small speech recognition system using Google's Speech Commands Dataset. I used librosa for preprocessing.
I built RNN-LSTM (3 layers) with dense(2 layers) for training. I deployed it as a Flask application. I also got familiarized with Nginx, Docker and AWS
